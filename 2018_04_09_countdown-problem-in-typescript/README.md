# The countdown problem implemented in TypeScript


I highly encourage you to watch the whole course [Dr. Erik Meijer - Functional Programming Fundamentals](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals)

I implemented [The Countdown Problem](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals/C9-Lectures-Dr-Graham-Hutton-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals-Chapter-11-of-13) not in Hashell, but in TypeScript. Lazy evaluation of generators emulates nicely
[the list comprehensions](https://wiki.haskell.org/List_comprehension)
 from Haskell.
